## ARCHITECTURE

### Directory Structure (after route group refactoring)
```
src/app/
  layout.tsx              ← root: <html>, <body>, metadata, globals.css
  (site)/
    [locale]/
      layout.tsx          ← font vars, NextIntlClientProvider, Navbar, Footer
      page.tsx            ← homepage
      about/
      services/
      press/
      awards/
      events/
      contact/
      important-notice/
  (studio)/
    layout.tsx            ← minimal full-height div wrapper
    studio/
      [[...tool]]/
        page.tsx          ← NextStudio component
  api/
```

### Key Config Files
- `sanity.config.ts` — Sanity Studio config (needs `basePath: '/studio'`)
- `src/lib/sanity/config.ts` — project ID, dataset, API version
- `src/lib/sanity/client.ts` — read client + write client
- `src/lib/sanity/queries.ts` — all GROQ queries
- `next.config.js` — Next.js config
- `tailwind.config.ts` — custom colors, fonts

### Design System
**Fonts:**
- Crimson Pro — serif, used for headings
- Inter — sans-serif, used for body (stand-in for Neue Montreal until they purchase it)
- Aptos — fallback

**Colors (Tailwind custom):**
- `dark-900` — primary background (#0a0a0a or similar near-black)
- `dark-800` — slightly lighter sections
- `dark-700` — card backgrounds, alternating sections
- `dark-600` — borders, subtle dividers
- `gold-400` — primary accent (buttons, highlights, hover states)
- `gold-500` — darker gold for text
- White text throughout on dark backgrounds

**Design references Rachel likes:**
- Charles Monat (monat.com) — minimal, big fonts, eye-catching photos, simple page structure
- New CIES — formal look with some white/light sections
- UBS HK Contact page — qualifying questions on contact form

## SANITY CMS

### Status
- ✅ Sanity project created (Ulrich's personal email)
- ✅ Schemas deployed (7 content types)
- ✅ Studio accessible at /studio (route group fix applied, commit 37e0bf2)
- ⚠️ `basePath: '/studio'` may still need adding to sanity.config.ts
- ⚠️ Migration script NOT yet run — Studio is empty, all content still hardcoded
- ⚠️ Rachel needs to create her own Sanity account to be invited as Editor

### Sanity Schemas
1. **teamMember** — name, slug, role, category (management/advisory), photo, bio, order, isInvestmentCommittee
2. **service** — title, slug, shortDescription, icon, content, features, order
3. **pressArticle** — title, slug, publication, author, publishDate, summary, externalUrl, heroImage, thumbnailImage, language
4. **award** — title, organization, year, category, image, description
5. **event** — title, slug, date, location, description, heroImage, gallery, speakers, ctaText, ctaEmail
6. **siteSettings** (singleton) — companyName, phone, email, all contact info, heroHeading, heroSubtext, missionStatement, trustBarStats, disclaimerText, fraudNoticeText
7. **legalPage** — title, slug, content, lastUpdated

### ENV Variables (in Vercel + .env.local)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production`
- `SANITY_API_TOKEN`

## COMPLETED WORK (Commits History)

### Phase 1 — Scaffolding & Deployment
- Next.js 14 project scaffolded with TypeScript + Tailwind
- Dark luxury theme implemented
- Deployed to Vercel (blackhorn-web.vercel.app)
- All pages built: Homepage, About, Services (6 individual), Press, Awards, Events, Contact, Legal pages
- 53 pages total, 0 build errors

### Phase 2 — Content Population
- All team member bios populated (Mary Yuen, Yugi Harada, Alan Lee, Wilson Hui, Nejteh Yaghoubian, Peter Tsang, Andrew Lo)
- 6 services with full descriptions and features
- 7 press articles with summaries and external links
- 9 awards
- 2 events (3rd Anniversary Dinner, Entrepreneur Night)
- Legal pages: Terms of Service, Complaint Handling Policy, Important Notice
- Trust bar stats on homepage (AUM, Years, Team, Bank Partners)
- SFC license badge

### Phase 2 — Design Refinements (Rachel Feedback Round 1)
- **Typography:** Crimson Pro (serif headings) + Inter (sans body) + Aptos (fallback)
- **Colors expanded:** dark-700, dark-800, dark-600 variants for section alternation
- **Fraud Notice Modal:** Dismissable popup on first visit (localStorage), linked from footer
- **Important Notice page:** Static page at /important-notice with full fraud warning text (31 May 2024)
- **Alternating section backgrounds** across pages

### Phase 2 — Hero Images
- Victoria Peak golden sunset (from Rachel's original Wix site)
- Victoria Harbour dusk with Star Ferry
- Dark gradient overlays applied

### Phase 2 — Logo Transparency Fix
- Converted JPG logos (with black backgrounds) to transparent PNGs
- Created three variants:
  - `blackhorn-logo-dark-en-transparent.png` (white, English only — navbar/footer)
  - `blackhorn-logo-dark-transparent.png` (white, with Chinese text)
  - `blackhorn-logo-light-transparent.png` (black, for light backgrounds)

### Phase 2 — Sanity CMS Integration
- All schemas created and deployed
- Studio route set up with separate layout (route groups)
- GROQ queries written for all content types
- Components connected with fallback pattern (site works with empty CMS)
- Revalidation endpoint at /api/revalidate
- Studio excluded from next-intl middleware matcher

### Phase 2 — Studio Layout Fix (Commit 37e0bf2)
- Fixed blank /studio page (React hydration error from double <html> tags)
- Separated site and studio into route groups: (site) and (studio)
- Root layout provides <html>/<body>, route group layouts handle their own concerns

## PENDING / IN PROGRESS

### Ready to Run (prompts already written)
1. **Sanity data migration** — Run scripts/migrate-to-sanity.ts to populate CMS with all existing hardcoded content
2. **Hero images update** — Replace heroes with Rachel's new scenery photos:
   - `hk-peak-sunset-hires.jpg` (2500x1522) → Homepage hero
   - `hk-harbour-masked.jpg` (3000x2000, black sky) → About page hero
   - `hk-night-aerial.jpg` (1600x896) → Services/Contact/inner pages
   Process with Sharp: resize to max 1920px, convert to WebP, generate blur placeholders
3. **Remove fraud popup + diamond shapes** — Delete FraudNoticeModal component (keep /important-notice page), remove decorative diamond/horn SVG shapes from hero corners
4. **basePath fix** — Add `basePath: '/studio'` to sanity.config.ts

### Rachel Feedback Round 2 — THREE PHASES

**Phase A — Quick Fixes (DO THIS NEXT):**
- Navbar text contrast: change grey menu items to white, gold hover states, solid dark-900 background
- Contact CTA component: reusable section at bottom of every page (above footer) with "Ready to discuss?" heading + Book a Consultation button + phone link
- Homepage hero color tuning: lighten gradient overlay so sunset photo shows through more (Rachel wants it to look like her pitchbook)
- Scam warning banner contrast check

**Phase B — Structural (AFTER Phase A):**
- Split About page into sub-pages:
  - /about/our-expertise
  - /about/our-philosophy
  - /about/commitment-to-results
  - /about/partnerships
  - /about/leadership (management team)
  - /about/advisors (advisory board)
- Add dropdown navigation menus (About dropdown with sub-pages, possibly Services too)
- Each sub-page follows Charles Monat pattern: Hero/quote → content with side photos → Contact CTA

**Phase C — Design Overhaul (AFTER Phase B):**
- Mixed dark/light design: some sections with white background + dark text for formality
- Charles Monat-inspired inner page template (minimal, big fonts, eye-catching photos)
- UBS HK-style contact form with qualifying questions (Are you an existing client? Investor type? Services interested in?)
- Overall color tone refinement

### Blockers from Rachel (content still needed)
- Privacy Policy (legal counsel, PDPO-compliant)
- Wilson Hui high-res headshot
- Peter Tsang headshot
- Andrew Lo headshot
- Updated team photos (she mentioned newer versions)
- Neue Montreal font files (or confirm license purchase — ~$50 from Pangram Pangram)
- LinkedIn URL confirmation
- Additional team members to add? (Andy Yuen, Wong Po Sum, Danika Ma, Gregory Ng, Jody Leung)
- Chinese logo preference: 晉羚集團 vs 晉羚財富管理
- Family Office page structure decision
- Chinese translations (infrastructure ready, content needed)
- Contact form recipient confirmation

## FUTURE FEATURES DISCUSSED

### Event Registration System (invitation-only)
Rachel requested Eventbrite-like features but firm is SFC-regulated — can't have public registration. Solution: invitation-only system where Rachel uploads guest list → unique invite links generated → clients RSVP via private link → QR codes for check-in. No public registration page.

### AI-Powered Internal Tools (separate project)
Discussed building local AI tools for the firm using Ollama (on-premise, no data leaves office):
- Client meeting brief generator
- Post-meeting notes structuring
- Bank statement auto-rename/filing tool
- Research digest summarizer
- Bilingual content drafting
- RFP/DDQ response automation
- Compliance monitoring

## IMPORTANT NOTES

- The site is NOT live on blackhorngrp.com yet — still on Vercel staging
- All content is currently HARDCODED — migration script needs to run to populate Sanity
- The site works without Sanity data (fallback pattern) so it won't break if CMS is empty
- Rachel expects to be able to edit content via Sanity Studio — she needs onboarding
- The /studio route works but may show "Tool not found: studio" until basePath is added
- Images from Rachel came as SVG wrappers around embedded JPEGs — already extracted to proper formats
- next-intl is set up for i18n but Chinese content hasn't been written yet
